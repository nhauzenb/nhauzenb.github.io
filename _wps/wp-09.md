<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract.</b> We propose and discuss Bayesian machine learning methods for mixed data sampling (MIDAS) regressions. This involves handling frequency mismatches with restricted and unrestricted MIDAS variants and specifying functional relationships between many predictors and the dependent variable. We use Gaussian processes (GP) and Bayesian additive regression trees (BART) as flexible extensions to linear penalized estimation. In a nowcasting and forecasting exercise we focus on quarterly US output growth and inflation in the GDP deflator. The new models leverage macroeconomic Big Data in a computationally efficient way and offer gains in predictive accuracy along several dimensions.
