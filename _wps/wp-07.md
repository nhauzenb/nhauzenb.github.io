<p align="justify"> <b>Abstract.</b> Timely information about the state of regional economies can be essential for planning, implementing and evaluating locally targeted economic policies. However, European regional accounts for output  are published at an annual frequency and with a two-year delay.  To obtain robust and more timely measures in a computationally efficient manner, we propose a mixed-frequency dynamic factor model that accounts for national information to produce high-frequency estimates of the regional gross  value added (GVA). We show that our model produces reliable nowcasts of GVA  in 162 regions across 12 European countries.
