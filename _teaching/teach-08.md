### Overview.
<p align="justify"> This class teaches quantitative methods with a practical emphasis. Students will gain an understanding of aspects of econometric theory and of fundamental econometrics tools that are routinely used in the analysis of economic data. They will apply the methods they learn about to a variety of models and data sets used in economics and finance. On completion of the class students should be in a position to motivate and conduct their own empirical work, and they will have the opportunity to demonstrate this in their summer projects.
